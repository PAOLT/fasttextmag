a couple of things have changed since five years ago when we launched together with some of you the digital agenda for europe   
the first thing I think is that five years ago people said oh that should be nice to have 
and people said are you want to talk to stakeholders about that whereas now in twenty fifteen it's natural that we should have it and we're allowed to talk to stakeholders and it's natural you should come 
so i think the the way in which we're doing business around digital has come a long way 
and i think that the the quality of the discussion and the warmth of the comments on the twitter feed bears that out  
the the thing i'd like you to do after my few remarks as you leave is make sure you have one of these little paper cards which is a reminder to you to remain in the conversation 
so as was announced by mister Ansip at the beginning the conversation continues 
on thursday mister Oettinger is having a twitter chat so we're really interested in in containing your thoughts today but also continuing the debate 
a few things that I've heard I mean 
the first thing is we still have the same good brand so connect is not just the name of a directorate general it's also what we need to do 
and at the beginning m e p Boni and Schwab were both saying we have to bring issues together be holistic and as mister Schwab said rather 
I think bravely if that means we have to forget about some national laws in order to have a Europe fit for purpose in the global Internet age so be it 
so being willing to see the big picture and to accept the challenges that flow from that big picture are not easy challenges but that's what we have to keep in mind  
think about something like spectrum 
no smart industry four point zero motor industry will survive without joined-up spectrum across Europe but in terms of constitutional change that's going to be one of the be challenges for the year ahead 
the second thing we have to connect is data 
and John Higgins gave us the challenge at the beginning where's the big hairy visible benchmark 
and now as mister Oettinger announced and it's already out there with daisy d e s i I you have a big hairy data benchmark that you can look at to compare as a composite index country with country did you dig into the data play with the graphs and find out whether that tells you where you in your region or country of Europe needs to go 
so connections  
secondly I've been as always am as a non technologist impressed by what technology can do on its own thank you very much 
I think throughout the day some of the examples that have been put out there around what technology can do remind us as officials and as policymakers that it may well be we just need to leave some space for technology 
I stuff which the tech is understand Tony short or mentioned at one stage in a v p n might be the answer to everything  
Alan Graham one-click licensing is a really interesting innovation which I get trying to find problems with but I'm very interested to see where that will go 
Despina Spanou saying if online dispute resolution is at the point of problem for a consumer maybe that resolves a lot of the mistrust and frustration 
so instead of getting blocked and locked out we find a solution or at least to find a conversation at the right point 
and right through to some of the examples from the last panel notably Carla's custom crafted skull I mean this is something we may we may need going forward 
so giving space for technology 
and I think underlying that is the challenge which several people put before us can we give that space so that startup entrepreneurs get an easy a deal 
is there a way that I you can have a passport that says I'm a start-up entrepreneur or I'm inventing something new and all regulators go away  
that's what we call the innovation principle so conceptually even people in the bureaucracy of Europe are thinking about it  
but how do you stand it up 
it's almost more difficult to conceive than that other thing the precautionary principle but we need it 
people the the third point 
I think that in the last session we begin to get to the importance of what it means to be human in the digital age and we saw that I thought a bit less than I had expected in the Consumer Panel but people have real needs that the agenda we're now laying out have to meet so get me online
I have no connectivity and I don't go on the internet regularly one in three citizens
so if they could all be at a click of a finger brought online and given the basic skills the online market grows by fifty percent 
but we haven't done it we've talked about inclusion for five years so we have to seriously think about that 
and what does it take in one city i visited recently of five hundred thousands people liverpool they have fifty eight municipal drop in digitization hubs for individuals families school teachers and n g o 
so one per ten thousandth of the population 
we don't have that sort of density of network of help available across Europe 
so there's a there's a postcode lottery about help for the disenfranchised twenty thirty percent  
even if you're online you need skills 
so one of the Junker college priorities is a skill strategy for Europe
within it the digital skills strategy which mister Oettinger and we are working on has to be a strong pillar and we're ready to make it an early area of experiment we've had the grand coalition beginning to network around these issues but just as with inclusion we talk about it we have a vision but we're not yet executing  
and the third element there which we talk about but don't yet quite achieve and Zoran spoke about it right at the end is digitizing entrepreneur mindsets making it easier for people who know their entrepreneurs and know the digital stuff is out there to get into the game 
so people have lots of needs where we can help positively and there might just be some stuff where people need help where the market won't in the end satisfactorily protect and encourage them  
again Schwab mentioned one point 
personal profiling driven price fixing 
there is no price discovering in the online market anymore and it's going down 
so how do we deal with that 
can we give data dashboards the way that Organe France  telecom or even Facebook do so that individuals can understand what my data is being used for where it's going and beyond that give me some consent 
can we use ecommerce trust marks more 
and finally and again it came up in the last panel can we use the horizon twenty twenty vision of responsible innovation to build trust in the new stuff that's coming down the track  
two other questions that I just want to touch on before I finished  
the the penultimate question is balance  
there were several points throughout the day where we don't know the answer yet 
what is our social preference as Europe in the digital age 
how much copyright protection how much access how much support for creators how much data protection as our Latvian presidency colleague reminded us and how much space for data driven innovation how much space for startups and how much aversion to risk and the last the last conundrum tabled by the last panel what scope for standards to drive interoperability and what scope for standards to drive closed gardens   
so there are some difficult issues where there are no calculable single answers and it's on those issues and I may not have got the full list out there that we will need real help for more detailed discussions to get the politics right in the next couple of months  
but finally because here we are in Brussels what about Europe   
I thought there was some really interesting points throughout the day 
I mean the first again from honest was how can we actually work together when we have twenty eight smart and proud nation states  
i really like that and on the National Day of the presidency country that's a very strong thing to say 
that's the problem that Europe has to face to reconcile ourselves with doing things together 
and actually the industry four point zero challenge is the same 
as mister Ottinger has said himself we have industry four point zero in one country we have catapults in another we have different models in different countries  
how do we join them together not to harmonize because i don't think the Commission can do that but to make sure that they're not overlapping eating out of each other's muesli bowl how can we make that work together   
secondly can we be fast that was something which I thought was really important where we don't need to act we shouldn't act where we do need to act we better get it done at internet speed and not over the next decade  
That is a challenge which you might say you leave to the bureaucrats but kindly encourage us to get it right 
is the European Council giving guidance
Is there a digital minister  
is there a digital high official a really high official coming regularly to Brussels the way they do for trade policy 
what is our cycle time 
and if there are some things that get to the policy-making market faster regulations rather than directives co-regulation rather than either council decisions can we use them instead of doing the same old same old 
so I think that the the challenges for Europe there right at the end are really big ones we can start tackling those here in Brussels 
but for most of the rest I have learned a lot today but I don't think we've answered all the questions  
those are just my personal takeaways and you will all have your own  
the key I think is that my colleagues will be putting up a lot of this material in ways you can reflect on on the website remember the little card 
and we really do need your help so tomorrow it's Copenhagen Thursday it's on Twitter with mister Oettinger and so on we need your help every day to make this work   
ladies and gentlemen thank you very much 
thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
so when you open my body after I've died you will find the blackened heart of a European civil servant and inscribed on it will be the word amflora
now amflora as some of you will know is a b a s f event of G M technology of industrial potato with better starch for industrial use than your average chip potato 
and they submitted it for European approval in nineteen ninty six
you ask bureaucrats in Brussels they say it's fine we approved it in two thousand and ten 
and at about the same time B A S F said you know we're out of here 
and one hundred fity world-class research jobs moved away from Europe 
and so why do I worry about that for obvious abroad economic and scientific impact reasons 
what are the lessons I can draw 
I would mention three 
firstly lay people in my view need to be in from day one in the scientific journey and not only when we're ready to market a product 
that's kind of the concept of what the literature calls responsible research and innovation 
it's very challenging
but the best biotech startup C E Os I know go to primary schools in their travel to work area at least once a month not because it's sort of good P R but because they learn stuff that makes them think and they come back and do better work in their company 
so that would be my first point and then when you do that what will you find out 
one of the complicating factors for amflora was a guy called Arpad Pusztai who did so-called research showing that it was very bad for rats 
other scientists came after the event and said no no this is a poor study not representative 
it was too late 
the story was out there 
it was a negative story 
the media carried it 
and it was determining in my opinion in the distortion of the regulatory run of play
so you need to get lay people into the process not just with the scientists but also with the risk Assessors in order to have real-world questions and a little bit of real-world common sense 
and then the second thing you can do if you bring real people in early is to integrate behavioral psychology environmental signals that may distort our thinking as well as the sort of courting of do we understand what science is 
and fundamentally I think what we will discover if we ask those broad questions early of lay people is they are not even on the continent of Europe even in this country technophobic 
nobody's born against 
if Adelman did a study in twenty fifteeen what you think about technology and the answer was sixty percent of the a b c ones in a hundred countries got the fact that technology was going to be good for us economics growth jobs new better things 
sixty percent of the same sample doubted whether it was going to help people and planet 
so that's a fork in the road either we're doing the wrong science 
or we're doing the right science and we're failing to convince two out of three people that we're doing the right science 
so that's then a media point again 
so I think lay people in from the first and a listening process is the first guarantee that we can learn from G M and do going forward 
and the second is you need to say to the lay people what are your problems because we as scientists will bring the solution 
and we don't do that enough because if those lay people have been sitting there with amflora  saying our problems are our community in the environment there would have been good answers 
but if you let the bad stories about the rats and antibiotic resistance marker genes get out first you're dead
so I think that there's a huge set of lessons from G M I would say they're not lessons from the past because here in in England food processors still hesitate to use G M because they haven't got a public opinion ready to see it used 
so we still suffer an efficiency overhang downstream from the  G M debate 
and secondly it's existential 
at the moment we have too much fear about A I and not enough fear about cybersecurity 
and if you put those two together and as a result we get them wrong as badly as we did G M it's going to be today's problem not yesterday's
thank you
Parma
Parma is not the only beautiful city in Europe 
the unsustainable status Quo is not here in Parma
saying we must be open everybody come to Parma that would not be a success
efsa
a little bit about EFSA
you can imagine that when I was the DG working with Efsa I was learning A lot 
the issue that we in the EFSA world have to engage with is not food safety 
I want to pay tribute to those who do this in EFSA stand up for Science and truth
so any problem EFSA faces is going to be easier

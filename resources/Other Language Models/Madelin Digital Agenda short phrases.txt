so this is what I want to tell you about
what is our to-do list for the remainder of this commission mandate
and maybe if I start by saying what who are we what's us 
narrowly D G connect is twelve hundred civil servants working in Brussels and Luxembourg for one of the vice president's for Nellie Cruz
my job as a Director General what does it mean? 
It is either Sir Humphrey in Europe for those of you that watched Yes Minister 
or as I more often say to my colleagues the Director General indicates the general direction
everybody else knows actually what to do
but at another level the agenda can only be achieved by cooperation 
and this is not an area where the treaty gives the european union powers to negotiate on its own as on trade or to make decisions on its own like the competition commissioner 
here we are working in a collective participated leadership between public authorities big companies organizations of goodwill and the rest of european and indeed global partners
so as Nellie says so if it's the busiest year for her it's the busiest year for me
this is a crucial year on which to maintain momentum towards the goals we had 
this was the first Europe twenty twenty policy paper that was adopted by the Commission in 2010 
it had a hundred and one actions in it 
now what we're trying to do having made a good deal of progress is to focus on the things that matter 
but let me start by saying that we still believe that this agenda is crucial to recovery growth and jobs in Europe 
I was saying over lunch to some of you that the sense I had as a newcomer myself in twenty ten is that people said 
well you're a sort of I C T techie part of the European administration so you would say that all things telecom all things I T research would matter for Europe 
what I think has happened in the last two years is that everybody now gets the message 
there have been so many world-class reports demonstrating that the the growth rates that we enjoy can be tweaked up year by year if we have more I T inside than not 
and I think that progressively that message has been fully understood
I'm not going to take you through every slide they'll be there in case you want to have a crib sheet 
but it's clear that firstly we're talking already today in a narrow sense that the I C T sector is six percent of E U G D P 
but at one level it's a hundred percent of EU GDP 
because there are very few things you can do today as a profitable model or in terms of public good distribution to citizens without the IT inside 
but the other point that I would really emphasize is the second box up on the what will be for you the left-hand side
you don't have to be a high-tech S M E to benefit from I C T 
this is a boston consulting group survey
S M Es that put the web and I T into their business model who truly modernize and take advantage of what off-the-shelf high-tech has to offer 
they grow faster than everybody else 
and that's true in all the surveyed countries across Europe 
so if we want more growth and more jobs I T inside is the way to get it   
and the proof is that even on today's growth rates in the sector we're three-quarters of a million short of skilled graduates able to contribute to that sector 
so we face a huge potential crunch 
but let's look at the upside we face a huge potential bonanza in demand for high-quality jobs
and they're not jobs which you have to do 20 years in a lab 
their jobs where experience around the world shows that you can do 12 to 18 months upskilling and begin to be useful 
there are some you know there are some high-tech stuff where you do need 20 years in a lab 
but there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to be built if we get this right 
and I think that those who are telling us what they believe Europe should be doing agree with that 
so eight out of ten say let's have more coordination to do it right on the I C T front 
let's say that at national level as well nine out of ten want more to be done and again Education and Skills 
nine out of ten of our respondents when we did a reality check on our study said yes 
this is the right way to go but you need to focus more on education and skills 
and what you see here is that if we could move away still a step or two more to from national frameworks towards the digital single market then we would get more jobs more factor productivity growth 
so lower overheads for every company in the economy and higher G D P game 
this is another way of looking at the same thing
and what this one tells you is that it's true for public sector innovation as well 
in the country I know best which is across the water in the UK 
they're currently debating do we need to reform the civil service? 

5'35" / 5'40" the answer as a lifelong civil servant is always yes but be careful with us 

in a country like this I think there are debates as well about how many people do you need and how should you structure them 
if you restructure the way you deliver public services to incorporate ambient I T 
so pensioners know that by default they can get everything they want from the comfort of their sitting room or the local library 

5'59" / 6'01" if they don't they can have paper if they like 

then you begin to change the way in which a whole public administration works 
and there are countries that do very well in pushing towards that 
there are good news examples about how you empower that less favoured citizens whether the old the unemployed the less educated in this country and malta in norway in poland 
so we need to do more on that 
there are people who don't yet have the abilities to interact over the web with their public administrations 
but we can fix that and we need to fix that 
so public sector innovation is part of the story as well 
but let me then come to one that I personally believe is the big focus for this year which is entrepreneurship
in Davos at the end of next month my boss will be among others pushing for a more supportive environment for high tech entrepreneurs across Europe 
many of the biggest companies whether in this country or other member states are also i think catching on to the idea 
that it's not enough for them to grow their own supply chain and their own echo system 
it's in their interest to spread the good news to devote I C T know how 
whether that's in a high-tech company or in the advertising sector to enabling new entrepreneurs to say 
yes I can do this 
I understand how I can do it 
so there is a gap between the eight out of ten school leavers who say 
I've got an idea I could be an entrepreneur and the one out of ten who actually try it 
we need to close that gap 
we need to make it possible for more talented young people to try to do the things they want to do 
and at the other end we need to take away some of the obstacles that will trip them up 
the tax regime is suboptimal for startups in every country in Europe 
we could tweak some of that 
and ICT is part of that but entrepreneurship is the big skill 
now then I added a little arrow to this slide which I take ground everywhere and you can't see everything
but broadly on the on the vertical axis you have the World Economic Forum competitive index 
and across the bottom fixed broadband lines per hundred of the population 
and Ireland is at the sharp end of the arrow 
so pretty much on the latest statistics in the middle 
you've got people like the netherlands at the top end 
equal like Bulgaria at the bottom 
and therefore I use that not to engage in a sort of beauty contest  
but to observe that if the competitiveness agenda the sort of conditions for entrepreneurship that I've just been discussing are important
you can see that in the part of Europe we're standing in today there are issues both on the I C T specific agenda rolling out more broadband 
which means investing more and building the demand and also on the issue of the broader business climate
and in addition to fixing those two things we have to fix the way individual citizens think about this very techie environment 
I don't think my grandmother quite trusted the motorcar 
my mother didn't trust video machines 
and there are a lot of people still alive in Europe today who don't trust the internet 
and probably they were all not wrong in their degree of suspicion 
but we need as a continent to grow more quickly comfortable with new profiles of risk in new areas of activity 
not so that we do everything naively 
but so that we make a sober personal choice 
as opposed to saying I don't want that it's too difficult 
so building trust and justifying trust are two very crucial missing bits of the of the mix of the moment  
and then if I look more generally 
so here we have the International comparisons around those three sets of issues 
competitiveness IT rollout trust
you also got research you've got education training labour market 
from a distance it's all pretty much of a muchness so you might say 
well so Japan Canada the US and Europe it's about the same 
but there are some quite telling new horses if we compare these spider charts 
and as I apologize that it's a bit small for those at the back 
so broadly what this tells you is it's we are the worst 
and with the margin by which Europe needs to pick up most is the labor market and employment conditions 
so that's not all about trashing European values 
we need to do something about that however 
and all social inclusion of course we're among the best 
but we're not the best 
Canada's the best 
so this is not a right-left debate 
if we if we're right to say those are the pillars of competitiveness 
it's not about do you sweat the workers or maintain the welfare state 
because there are other places in the world that are growing faster who have a better overall profile and who are in the social sphere I would say pretty supportive a bit like Europe 
so so worth knowing that we can do better in areas like innovation in areas like the enterprise environment in areas like research 
without necessarily having a highly political and divisive debate about destroying society or something of that sort 
now the to-do list 
I mean this is the only slide you really need to retain 

11'37" / 11'40" and it's in slightly bigger print they're probably still a bit small for those at the back

so I'm just going to read it out 
these are the seven actions that we have concluded having achieved a lot of the previous hundred one are the focus for the next two years at least 
so the broadband regulatory environment 
there are people more expert than me about that in the room 
but what we've decided to do there and nearly announced it in the summer 
is to try to adjust the regulatory environment in Europe 
so you can have still enough competition and a bit more investment 
secondly we're currently negotiating under the Irish chairmanship to finalize the budget planning from twenty fortheen onwards 
we want a new tool called a connecting Europe facility to connect better the bits that the market doesn't yet reach 
not only in I C T also in energy and also in transport 
and the three fit together because as as is clear in this country and in some others energy companies can stream fiber over their high tension wires 
so so the three are not three separate silos but that's the second thing 
a bit more public financial support to more rollout of broadband and to the provision of services over it 
so cross-border access to your e-health data if you fall ill in London 
cross-border access to your verified government ID if you want to have public services in some other part of Europe that you're legally entitled to 
but what sort of proof do you have to give and so on and so on 
thirdly on the back of the Davos agenda coming back to Brussels in March to launch a grand coalition on skills and jobs 
whereby we go to the big companies 
we go to the employment centers 
we go to the tertiary Institute's 
we say so we don't have enough skills and young people don't have enough jobs 
and these problems are coinciding in specific towns and cities around Europe 
can we set a specific agenda where we're going to get these skills in this town and different skills in another town 
and hopefully with a commitment as we've got in some Member States people coming out of that process will at least interview them 
or the dream people coming out of that process with the good diploma we're going to try them out for 18 months at least 
thirdly cyber security 
so this is on the trust part 
every time you see about cybersecurity you see the bad news
because you see about Sony Playstation 
you see about the latest in my case was that the Belgian railways had lost all the subscriber information from anybody would ever bought a ticket from them in the last six months 
so you see problems
we believe that the problems often are cross border 
and the agencies which may be effective in different member states are actually not so effective of talking to each other 
so the modest proposal for cooperation coming soon coordinated between the I T Commissioner Baroness Ashton who does the Foreign Affairs and C E O Malmstrom who's the security commissioner 
copyright again modest but we need to have on the basis of the structured dialogue that we've already begun but we'll finish this year some clear vision how to make territorial rules such as copyright fit for a digital world which is inherently borderless 
accelerating our work on cloud computing 
the clouds the next big thing 
we don't use enough of it 
it's growing more slowly in Europe as a business case than in North America and from a lower base 
so we really need to catch up there 
and finally coming back to the research side that also depends on Irish chairmanship of the budget discussions 
in two thousand fortheen we start the next not a ten year or five year plan 
the next seven year plan for research and innovation in Europe 
we need to have a better industrial strategy to maintain and to retain in some cases and regain in others a leading place for Europe in what we call key enabling technologies 
the CATS and emerging electronics the next generations of chips the next generations of computing both in data centers and embedded in your cars and aeroplanes are we think an area where Europe can big be a big winner 

so those are the seven areas that we intend to focus on 
that's the hard core of the Digital Agenda and if we get it right there will be more growth and jobs 
and the question which I mean I don't have the answer to this question but I think it's the right question 
what can be done at every level across Europe to take the right proportions of this sort of agenda and make it a national agenda 
on the broadband side for example in most countries over the last two years and Ireland is no exception there is a national broadband plan 
it has to be national and it has to have local granularity 
because what they're already varies and how you can build the market towards what you need will vary 
but the key question is what can be done at different levels 
and how from the smallest sub municipal redevelopment plan in an old steel mill in Wales which was where I was on Friday right up to sort of rarefied reaches of the european council chaired by the by the t-shirt 
at every level we need to work out how it fits together so that's the key question
and then I've put at the end some some links in case keen members of the audience want to dig deeper 
so madam chairman thank you very much

a couple of things have changed since five years ago when we launched together with some of you the digital agenda for europe 
the first thing I think is that five years ago people said oh that should be nice to have 
and people said are you want to talk to stakeholders about that 
whereas now in twenty fifteen it's natural that we should have it and we're allowed to talk to stakeholders and it's natural you should come 
so i think the the way in which we're doing business around digital has come a long way 
and i think that the the quality of the discussion and the warmth of the comments on the twitter fool bears that out 
the the thing i'd like you to do after my few remarks as you leave is make sure you have one of these little paper cards which is a reminder to you to remain in the conversation 
so as was announced by mister Ansip at the beginning the conversation continues 
on thursday mister Oettinger is having a twitter chat so we're really interested in in containing your thoughts today but also continuing the debate 
a few things that I've heard
I mean the first thing is we still have the same good brand so connect is not just the name of a directorate general it's also what we need to do 
and at the beginning m e p Boni and Schwab were both saying we have to bring issues together be holistic 
and as mister Schwab said rather I think bravely if that means we have to forget about some national laws in order to have a Europe fit for purpose in the global Internet age so be it 
so being willing to see the big picture and to accept the challenges that flow from that big picture are not easy challenges 
but that's what we have to keep in mind 
think about something like spectrum no smart industry four point zero motor industry will survive without joined-up spectrum across Europe 
but in terms of constitutional change that's going to be one of the big challenges for the year ahead 
the second thing we have to connect is data 
and John Higgins gave us the challenge at the beginning where's the big hairy visible benchmark 
and now as mister Oettinger announced and it's already out there with daisy d a i s y i you have a big hairy data benchmark that you can look at to compare as a composite index country with country 
did you dig into the data play with the graphs and find out whether that tells you where you in your region or country of Europe needs to go
so connections 
secondly I've been as I always am as a non technologist impressed by what technology can do on its own thank you very much 
I think throughout the day some of the examples that have been put out there around what technology can do remind us as officials and as policymakers that it may well be we just need to leave some space for technology 
I stuff which the tech is understand Tony short or mentioned at one stage in a v p n might be the answer to everything 
Alan Graham one-click licensing is a really interesting innovation which I get trying to find problems with but I'm very interested to see where that will go 
Despina Spanou saying if online dispute resolution is at the point of problem for a consumer maybe that resolves a lot of the mistrust and frustration 
so instead of getting blocked and locked out we find a solution or at least to find a conversation at the right point 
and right through to some of the examples from the last panel notably Carla's custom crafted skull I mean this is something we may we may need going forward 
so giving space for technology and I think underlying that is the challenge which several people put before us can we give that space so that startup entrepreneurs get an easy a deal
is there a way that I you can have a passport that says I'm a start-up entrepreneur or I'm inventing something new and all regulators go away
that's what we call the innovation principle so conceptually even people in the bureaucracy of Europe are thinking about it 
how do you stand it up 
it's almost more difficult to conceive than that other thing the precautionary principle but we needed
people the the third point I think that in the last session we begin to get to the importance of what it means to be human in the digital age 
and we saw that I thought a bit less than I had expected in the Consumer Panel 
but people have real needs that the agenda we're now laying out has to meet 
so get me online I have no connectivity and I don't go on the internet regularly 
one in three citizens 
so if they could all be at a click of a finger brought online and given the basic skills 
the online market grows by fifty percent 
but we haven't done it 
we've talked about inclusion for five years so we have to seriously think about that 
and what does it take in one city i visited recently of five hundred thousands people liverpool 
they have fifty eight municipal drop in digitization hubs for individuals families school teachers and n g os 
so one per ten thousandth of the population we don't have that sort of density of network of help available across Europe
so there's a there's a postcode lottery about help for the disenfranchised twenty thirty percent 
even if you're online you need skills so one of the Junker college priorities is a skill strategy for Europe within it 
the digital skills strategy which mister Oettinger and we are working on has to be a strong pillar and we're ready to make it an early area of experiment 
we've had the grand coalition beginning to network around these issues 
but just as with inclusion we talk about it we have a vision but we're not yet executing 
and the third element there which we talked about but don't yet quite achieve and Zoran spoke about it right at the end is digitizing entrepreneur mindsets making it easier for people who know their entrepreneurs and know the digital stuff is out there to get into the game
so people have lots of needs where we can help positively 
and there might just be some stuff where people need help where the market won't in the end satisfactorily protect and encourage them 
again Schwab mentioned one point
personal profiling driven price fixing
there is no price discovering in the online market anymore and it's going down so how do we deal with that 
can we give data dashboards the way that france telecom or even Facebook do so that individuals can understand what my data is being useful where it's going and beyond that give me some consent 
can we use ecommerce trust marks more and finally and again it came up in the last panel 
can we use the horizon twenty twenty vision of responsible innovation to build trust in the new stuff that's coming down the track 
two other questions that I just want to touch on before I finished 
the the penultimate question is balance
there were several points throughout the day where we don't know the answer yet
what is our social preference as Europe in the digital age 
how much copyright protection 
how much access 
how much support for creators 
how much data protection as our Latvian presidency colleague reminded us 
and how much space for data driven innovation 
how much space for startups and how much aversion to risk 
and the last the last conundrum tabled by the last panel what scope for standards to drive interoperability and what scope for standards to drive closed gardens 
so there are some difficult issues where there are no calculable single answers 
and it's on those issues and I may not have got the full list out there that we will need real help for more detailed discussions to get the politics right in the next couple of months
but finally because here we are in Brussels what about Europe 
I thought there was some really interesting points throughout the day 
I mean the first again from honest was how can we actually work together when we have twenty eight smart and proud nation states i really like that 
and on the National Day of the presidency country that's a very strong thing to say 
that's the problem that Europe has to face to reconcile ourselves with doing things together 
and actually the industry four point zero challenge is the same 
as mister Ottinger has said himself we have industry four point zero in one country we have catapults in another we have different models in different countries 
how do we join them together not to harmonize because i don't think the Commission can do that but to make sure that they're not overlapping eating out of each other's muesli bowl how can we make that work together 
secondly oh can we be fast
that was something which I thought was really important 
where we don't need to act we shouldn't act where we do need to act we better get it done at internet speed and not over the next decade 
that is a challenge which you might say you leave to the bureaucrats but kindly encourage us to get it right 
is the European Council giving guidance 
is there a digital minister 
is there a digital high official a really high official coming regularly to Brussels the way they do for trade policy 
what is our cycle time and if there are some things that get to the policy-making market faster regulations rather than directives co-regulation rather than either council decisions can we use them instead of doing the same old same old
so I think that the the challenges for Europe there right at the end are really big ones we can start tackling those here in Brussels 
but for most of the rest I have learned a lot today but I don't think we've answered all the questions 
those are just my personal takeaways and you will all have your own the key I think is that my colleagues will be putting up a lot of this material in ways you can reflect on on the website remember the little card 
and we really do need your help so tomorrow it's Copenhagen Thursday it's on Twitter with mister Oettinger and so on 
we need your help every day to make this work 
ladies and gentlemen thank you very much

thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
so when you open my body after I've died you will find the blackened heart of a European civil servant and inscribed on it will be the word amflora
now amflora is some of you will know is a b a s f event of GM technology of industrial potato with better start for industrial use than your average chip potato 
and they submitted it for European approval in ninteen ninty six 
you ask bureaucrats in Brussels they say it's fine we approved it in two thousand and ten 
and at about the same time B A S F said you know we're out of here 
and one hundred and fifty world-class research jobs moved away from Europe 
and so why do I worry about that for obvious abroad economic and scientific impact reasons
what are the lessons I can draw 
I would I would mention three 
firstly lay people in my view need to be in from day one in the scientific journey and not only when we're ready to market a product 
that's kind of the concept of what the literature calls responsible research and innovation 
it's very challenging but the best biotech startup C E Os I know go to primary schools in their travel to work area at least once a month 
not because it's it's sort of good P R but because they learn stuff that makes them think and they come back and do better work in their company 
so that would be my first point 
and then when you do that what will you find out 
one of the complicating factors for am flora was a guy called Arpad Pusztai who did so-called research showing that it was very bad for rats 
other scientists came after the event and said no no this is a poor study not representative 
it was too late the story was out there it was a negative story the media carried it 
and it was determining in my opinion in the distortion of the regulatory run of play
so you need to get lay people in to the process not just with the scientists but also with the risk Assessors in order to have real-world questions and a little bit of real-world common sense 
and then the second thing you can do if you bring real people in noir early 
is to integrate behavioral psychology environmental signals that may distort our thinking as well as the sort of courting of do we understand what science is 
and fundamentally I think what we will discover if we ask those broad questions early of laypeople is they are not even on the continent of Europe even in this country technophobic
nobody's born against 
if Adelman did a study in twenty fifteen what you think about technology and the answer was sixty percent of the A B C ones in a hundred countries got the fact that technology was going to be good for us economics growth jobs knew better things 
sixty percent of the same sample doubted whether it was going to help people and planet 
so that's a fork in the road
either we're doing the wrong science 
or we're doing the right science 
and we're failing to convince two out of three people that we're doing the right science 
so that's then a media point again 
so I think lay people in from the first and a listening process is the first guarantee that we can learn from G M and do going forward 
and the second is you need to say to the lay people what are your problems because we as scientists will bring the solution 
and we don't do that enough 
because if those lay people have been sitting there with am floor are saying our problems are our community in the environment there would have been good answers 
but if you let the bad stories about the rats and antibiotic resistance marker genes get out first you're dead 
so I think that there's a huge set of lessons from G Ms 
I would say they're not lessons from the past because here in in England food processors still hesitate to use G M because they haven't got a public opinion ready to see it used 
so we still suffer an efficiency overhang downstream from the G M debate 
and secondly it's existential 
at the moment we have too much fear about A I and not enough fear about cybersecurity 
and if you put those two together and as a result we get them wrong as badly as we did G M it's going to be today's problem not yesterday's 
thank you

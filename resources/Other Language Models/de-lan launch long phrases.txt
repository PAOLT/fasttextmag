it is true that the timing is great because we just launched the beginning of a five-year project maybe a 10-year project to deliver a difficult agenda for europe
what does that mean as my commissioner vice president Nelli Cruz said what it means is every european digital
although in the european sphere we have the reputation of being extremely burocratic the underlying challenge of all the seven policy pillars in the Digital Agenda is how do you get five hundreds million European citizens to recognize that this is crucial for them 

if you go out in the street even in the vicinity of the information society directorate-general and you say what really matters then of course the list will begin my family my job my health the security in my society 
should give them ten points you still won't get digital things necessarily that 
if you ask them if they've got a mobile phone in their pocket the answer how it will be yes 
so the crucial challenge for us is to take the leaders in our societies at every level and to enable them to show to those around them that by investing more time and effort at community level in the digital future every part of Europe every citizen in Europe can do better 
and you can't do that from Brussels 
so because we have a digital agenda for europe we need things like this 
because only at the local level in my factory in my school in my local community can I realize that this matters to me 
if local factory leaders if local community government leaders understand that high-speed broadband and the services it can carry will do good things for their citizens then through smart purely through smart investment and through the application of new technology they can demonstrate that this is something that Europe should do 
or I think the the sorts of small projects here which will bring together real communities in several regions can unlock the gap between where we need to be and where we are today 
if through this sort of project you can not only demonstrate that it works for you but that it works for others then we have this learning aspect very clearly coming to the front 
we need the Digital Agenda people have to drive it 
the second is that's only going to become possible through regional and local level initiatives 
but the third point i want to say a bit about is what does it mean to be launching a learning application network 
and i wanted to say that it seems to me although it's very challenging for the different regions to come together 
I hope that if you do it you will build into your experience a desire to tell everybody else what's you are learning 
so that it's not just us learning together it's also us enabling the other regions in Europe to learn together 
you have the possibility in Europe to multiply the lessons your project like this 
and to reach very deeply across all the countries 
not only the ones in which you launch regions are embedded but across all the 27 and why not be on 
and I think that is the additional benefit that we have here to learn from within the project partners more broadly 
the second benefit is to learn from the S M E ecosystem vision across into e-learning e-government and the other areas of local community leads
because it's my conviction that if you can do this in a way that helps at S M Es to to link up then the Headmaster's of primary schools and their mistresses of local secondary school can link up as well 
and that is the future 
if we can demonstrate that across the whole of Europe these sorts of learning experiences are applicable firstly within the economic sphere but then more broadly we will again get a faster multiplication of them up 
so fundamentally the digital agenda of Europe will deliver for Europe if demand grows faster than it does today and if the commitment to a digital vision grows faster than it is growing today 
and I am absolutely convinced that this sort of investment of time and energy that these regions have agreed to make can unlock that not just for your citizens but for all the citizens in the Union 
so I'm here really to say well done thank you very much

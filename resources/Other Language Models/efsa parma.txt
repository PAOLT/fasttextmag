Parma is not the only beautiful city in Europe 
the unsustainable status Quo is not here in Parma

efsa
a little bit about EFSA
you can imagine that when I was the DG working with Efsa I was learning A lot 
the issue that we in the EFSA world have to engage with is not food safety 
I want to pay tribute to those who do this in EFSA stand up for Science and truth
so any problem EFSA faces is going to be easier
